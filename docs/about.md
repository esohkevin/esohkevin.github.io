## About esohinformatics

Learning bioinformatics [in Africa] was especially challenging, at least 
for me. I learned the very hard way, mosty through google and youtube. 
But more importantly, by having a problem to solve, my MSc project. I 
believe patience and perseverance, in addtion to my passion and curiosity 
made all the difference. I eventually picked a few tricks that I could liken
to "the bioinformatics code" which might be useful to new learners.

**esohinformatics** is a platform to share my solutions to some of the problems 
I have encountered doing bioinformatics or problems tha come colleagues have 
brought to that do not have any comprehensive solutions in the public domain.
This will be in the form of tutorials and short posts.

I will also share some command-line tricks that can make my work easy.

## About me

My name is Kevin Esoh and I am from Cameroon.

I am a PhD candidate in Human Genetics in the Division of Human Genetics at the
University of Cape Town, South Africa. I work part-time as a Bioinformatician
for the [GeneMAP](https://twitter.com/GeneMAPOfficial){:target="_blank" title="Genetic Medicin of African Populations"}
research group.

I did my MSc studies in Bioinformatics and molecular biology in Kenya funded
by [DELGEME](https://www.delgeme.org/). My [project](http://ir.jkuat.ac.ke/handle/123456789/5663){:target="_blank" title="Developing Excellence in Leadership and Genetics Training for Malaria Elimination in Africa"}
wa based on malaria genomics in Cameroon where I first characterized the 
[genetic structure of some Cameroonian malaria-endemic populations](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79124-1){:target="_blank"}, 
and then I screened the genomes of the populations for markers of malaria 
susceptibility markers. The genetic strutcure study was published in 
*Scientific Reports*. The genome-wide assoction study (GWAS) uncovered 
two novel malaria protective genes and it is currently under review.

Before moving to Kenya, I did my undergrad studies in Cameroon at the University 
of Buea (UB) from 2012-2015. I majored in Biochemistry and minored in Medical Laboratory 
Technology graduating with first class honors (I couldn't have picked a better field). 

After my BSc program, I enrolled for an MSc in Biochemistry in UB from 2016-2017,
completed coursework and started a project before getting the scholarship to 
study in Kenya.

The project was bioinformatics-oriented as I had become particulary interested, 
in the field. The project was titled [Reverse vaccinology for Onchocerciasis vaccine development](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0rTlaNV5kvnTy0zY1RRY0Nld2c/view?resourcekey=0-gsC4CrSNEk4oVr96rVvvUw). I screened the entire proteome 
of *O. volvulus* (over 12,000 proteins) for antigenic or immunogenic proteins
with the goal of finding potential vaccine candidates. The project was continued
by my senior who was doing his PhD in Belgium on diagnostic strategies. I workied 
with him closely and we eventually published one of the first comprehensive
[papers](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-40833-x) on reverse
vaccinology based on multiple predicted epitopes from different antigenic proteins.
