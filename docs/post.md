1. [Good Bioinformatics practices](#.)
	- Avoide spaces in file and folder names.
	- Be consitent with file/folder naming ([https://datamanagement.hms.harvard.edu/collect/file-naming-conventions](https://datamanagement.hms.harvard.edu/collect/file-naming-conventions){:target="_blank"}) (see project management/research data management [plan]).
	- Use versioning.
	- README in every project base folder as well as important subfolder (see project management/research data management [plan]).
	- Changelog in important folders.
	- Keep packages updated (important!).

2. [Caring for your computer and other devices](#.)
	- Use browser bookmarks to manage pages/articles to visit/read later.
	- Turn off (power off) your computer/device from time to time to allow it to cool.
	- Update core packages/software regularly (Linux - apt-get update; Windows - check for updates).
	- Remove bloatware (packages/software that are of no use to you and are not necessary for your computer to function properly).
	- Turn off packages/software/bloatware that cannot be removed from starting on Start up (when you turn your computer on) or from running at all.
